      "description": "31 Leveson Crescent is a thoughtfully and substantially extended, 5 bedroom semi detached residence, requiring some modernisation and being most conveniently situated within a short strolling distance of the village centre.Overview31 Leveson Crescent is a thoughtfully and substantially extended, 5 bedroom semi detached residence, requiring some modernisation and being most conveniently situated within a short strolling distance of the village centre.Vendor CommentsWe bought this house 36 years ago having spent over six months looking at many houses throughout Balsall Common, Knowle, Dorridge and Kenilworth, many of which were detached but as soon as we saw this house, we immediately knew that this was the home for us.We had no children at the time but as our family grew, we decided to extend our property rather than to move.The rooms are large and light and our six children have always had their own bedrooms and plenty of space downstairs. The small front room has changed over the years having been used as office, bedroom, playroom and now sitting room.There is still great potential for an extended kitchen and the plumbing and electricity supply are already in place for a downstairs guest washroom but regretfully, the time has now come for us to retire and downsize.The back garden is very private and although larger than you would think, is easy to maintain. The large secluded front garden has a sweeping in and out drive and could be re-organised to provide extra parking space and perhaps a secure play area.Balsall Common has been a perfect area for bringing up our family and our home is adjacent to the Heart of England School. All local amenities are close at hand, there is an excellent bus service and Berkswell Railway Station (providing direct connections to Birmingham and London) is only a ten-minute walk away. Although Balsall Common is now a small town rather than a large Village we are surrounded by countryside providing the opportunity for walking, cycling etc.There continues to be a thriving local community and our neighbours on both sides, although having only recently moved in, are genuinely nice people with young families.Local AuthoritySolihull Borough Council",

      "description": "Internal inspection is essential on this impressively imposing family home with outstanding kerb appeal, set on one of the largest and most secluded plots on the development. This home has a vast amount of living space which can be adapted to suit any families requirements with three reception rooms, large kitchen/diner, two W/c's, utility room, garage, 5 bedrooms, en-suite and a family bathroom. With all the added luxuries expected, the property not only offers a fantastic lifestyle inside, it is also conveniently located close to various local shops, fantastic transport links and a stones throw from local schools.Internal descriptionUpon Entrance, the property leads into a bright, airy entrance hall with beautiful solid wood flooring and under-stairs storage perfect for coats and shoes. The hallway gives access to two of the three reception rooms, the kitchen/diner and a W/C.The first modern downstairs W/C is finished to a high standard with tiled walls and floors, conveniently located by the entrance making it ideal for visitors.The third reception room is a bright, spacious room with wooden flooring. This room was originally a second garage and has been converted into much more useful living space. The room is currently used as a playroom/music room but is a fantastic size and could be used as a guest room, with the downstairs bathroom conveniently located next to it.The main family lounge also runs off the hallway and is spectacular in size with a lovely bay window letting in plenty of natural light. The lounge has a feature fireplace and french doors leading through into the dining room. This offers the choice to have both a separate family lounge and formal dining room, or to open the lounge through to the dining area, perfect for family get togethers.The formal dining room is larger than average with patio doors leading out to the rear garden. The dining room also provides access through to the lounge and kitchen.The kitchen/diner is the heart of the home with a stunning modern fitted kitchen offering built in appliances, ample cupboard space and the most beautiful bespoke granite work surface, made in Italy. There is an additional built in breakfast bar and ample space for a family dining table.Through from the kitchen is a large utility space which is in-keeping with the kitchens units and work surfaces. The utility has space for laundry appliances and a door leading to the rear garden. The second modern fitted downstairs W/C can be found leading off the utility along with the internal garage.The first floor is accessible from the entrance hall up a beautiful wooden staircase leading onto a naturally bright gallery landing which provides access to each of the five bedrooms and the family bathroom.Each bedroom is as spacious as the next and each can comfortably accommodate a double bed. The master bedroom and second bedroom are especially generous in size, with the master benefiting from built in wardrobes and a modern fitted en- suite with a walk-in shower and under floor heating.The family bathroom also has under floor heating and a modern fitted white three piece suite, with the added bonus of a shower over the bath.There is access to the sizable loft from the landing which is fully boarded and spans corner to corner of the properties footprint. This space is easily accessible via a built in ladder and offers extensive storage space or the potential to create more living space.Outside spaceThe approach to the property is via a private drive where the property occupies a substantial amount of land to the front which is laid to lawn with mature shrubbery boarders. To the front there is also a private driveway which accommodates multiple vehicles and an integrated garage with electric which is large enough to comfortably fit a car and still leave space for storage. The garage also has part-boarded loft space with a fitted ladder.The rear garden is private as it is at the end of the close with no further houses beyond. In addition the current owners have purchased an additional plot of land which almost doubles the size of the original garden! The garden is mainly laid to lawn with a patio seating area and a gate giving access to the front of the property.In the agents opinion this is a beautiful family home offering bounds of space and potential to any growing family.Viewings are strictly through the agent by appointment only.EPC Rating - C",
